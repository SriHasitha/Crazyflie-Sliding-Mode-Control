# Crazyflie-Sliding-Mode-Control
This is a repository for project to design a robust sliding mode controller that can handle external disturbances and improve the trajectory tracking performance of the quadrotor. The repository can serve as a reference for students interested in learning about sliding mode control, quadrotor trajectory planning, and ROS node implementation.
